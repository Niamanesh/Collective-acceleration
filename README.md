This code is written in Fortran, by Amirali Niamanesh in People's Friendship University of Russia (RUDN), Physics department.

Type the command: gfortran main.f08 -o out (You need GCC compiler installed)
Run the file out and get your result.

At the beginning of the code, where you can see the comments, you can change the initial parameters of the programm such as density and etc.
The lab report of this code can be found here, availabe only in Russian, but come on, use google translate and you will be able to read it :).

For any question feel free to write me!
GOOD LUCK!
